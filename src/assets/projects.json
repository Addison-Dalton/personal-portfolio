      "description": "Pokédexle is a Pokémon guessing game. Like many, I was caught up in the Wordle craze of early 2022. I was also playing Pokémon Arceus at the time. The idea hit me that Pokémon would be a perfect adaptation, and thus Pokédexle was born. It's been one of my most favorite projects to date.",
